1)	Purpose.
	The traditional identity systems of today are fragmented, insecure, and exclusive. 
	Blockchain enables more secure management and storage of digital identities by 
	providing unified, interoperable, and tamper-proof infrastructure.

2)	System content.
	Users' data and it's exchange between users'/organizations' accounts.

3)	Interraction of the product.
	- Removes the need to deal with bureaucratic processes for issuing
	  identity documents.
	- One login for different platforms. Every social media and e-commerce 
	  platform has separate login and authentification pocesses. With the system,
	  user-controlled ID can be used to access different platforms. No third party
	  would be able to delete a data.
	- User controls a personal data.
	- Can deal with issues faced by refugees.

4)	Self-sovereign identity would allow users to :
	- Control their identities
	- Access and update information (though third-party verification may be required 
	  with some claims)
	- Choose the information that they prefer to keep private
	- Transport the data (to another organization or even another jurisdiction
	  if they relocate)
	- Delete the identity if that’s what is wanted 

5)	Such a system would need to ensure certain things :
	- Powerful algorithms to validate an identity and its claims
	- Independent of a particular platform or architecture
	- Identities to have a long shelf life (ideally forever)
	- Interoperability (to make it widely available)
	- Sharing of data only with the consent of the user
	- Organizations should be able to access only what is needed and 
	  not the complete information
	- Protection of user rights

6)	Users of the system :
	- self-sovereign identities
	- organizations 	

7)	Restrictions:
	- absence of control of managing Multiple Identities
